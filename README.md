B.	What is the application about?

Our application aims to assist users in life. Our application has a wifi speed test, motion sensor, light detector, card reader and temperature sensor. Users can on and off their room light from the dashboard which is very convenient if the user feels that the room is dark and find their switch really far from their seats. The wifi speed test is there to ensure user has a stable connection at all times and when the wifi speed drops user will be able to see from the gauge and save their data before they get disconnected and lose all their progress. The temperature sensor is to tell user what is the temperature outside like and users will be able to gauge if it is a sunny day or a cloudy day. The card reader is to unlock the house door. Lastly, the motion senser allows user to on the alarm which will trigger when it detects motion and then the user will receive an image on their telegram and email, and a message from twilio saying that there is and intruder
